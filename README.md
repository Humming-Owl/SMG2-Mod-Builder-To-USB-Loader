If you have a question, a problem, want to contribute improving the tool or to request a new hack go to "Issues" and open a new one.

If you have the original disc image of SMG2 or you can use Dolphin then you don't need at all to use this tool, this was designed for those who don't have the original game disc and/or a decent computer to run Dolphin. More info at "instructions/some_info.txt"

# Recomendations and notes:

I tested some of the hacks on USB Loader GX and they didn't work (I don't know why), because of that I recommend using ULoader to use the hacks, I've never encounter errors with it.

ULoader website --> https://www.elotrolado.net/wiki/ULoader

Also, play the hacks setting the language to English, I tried to play some hacks on Spanish (for example) and when talking to an NPC the game crashed, but on English everything went correctly.

I've only tested the hacks with the USA version of SMG2 so I really don't know if the other regional versions work 100%, but they should.

# Thanks to:

- The authors of these hacks. 
- Wiimm for his excellent tool. 
- JoshuaMKW for his GeckoLoader program that allows me to inject much more than the upper limit of Gecko codes into the "main.dol" file. 
- Viktormax3 and Dynexyst (I learned from their tools how to make this one).
