# SMG2-Mod-Builder-To-USB-Loader

If you want to contribute improving the tool and/or with a new hack go to "Issues" and open a new one.

If you have the original disc image of SMG2 or you can use Dolphin then you don't need at all to use this tool, this was designed for those who don't have the original game disc and/or a decent computer to run Dolphin. More info at "instructions/some_info.txt"
